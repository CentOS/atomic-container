# Docker Image Test Case: shellshock

This test case is derived from the [Docker Official Images Test Case](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/tree/master/test/tests/cve-2014--shellshock). The intention here is to ensure that the image is not vulnerable to [Shellshock vulnerability](https://access.redhat.com/announcements/1210053).
